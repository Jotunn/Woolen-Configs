//This used to be the nullmove script, but since that comes as an option in MasterComfig, that is recommended.

//This is enabled in a class-by-class basis at the bottom of each class config file by uncommenting "//exec crouchjump"

alias +crouchjump "+jump;+duck"   //remove +duck
alias -crouchjump "-jump;-duck"   //and -duck
