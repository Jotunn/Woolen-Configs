//Everything in here is executed on TF2's initial launch
//Feel free to add/remove/modify stuff as you please

//Jöt's note: I have altered and added to this to work better with MasterComfig,
//as well as making it easier to use for editing a custom HUD. Aside from that,
//grammar mistakes in the notes were cleaned up, and indentation has been evened.
//More information has been added to explain functions of code where relevant/useful.
//I also cleaned up the class configs and their various inconsistencies.

//----------------
// Launch options:
//----------------

//Open Steam, go to TF2, Right Click > Properties, General, Set Launch Options
//Remove // (comment markers) before pasting of course	
	//novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noborder -refresh 240
//Change -refresh 144 if you don't use a 144hz monitor

// ---------------
// Networking stuff 
// ---------------
 
// Don't mess with them unless you know what you're doing, MasterComfig has most of these covered for most users, uncomment and alter what you need only.
 
	//cl_cmdrate 67 //some configs have these on 66, doesn't really matter though
	//cl_updaterate 67 //just keep these as the same number
	//cl_interp_ratio 2
	//rate 80000 //set it too high and you'll increase your ping, set it too low and you'll drop packets
	//cl_lagcompensation 1 
	//cl_pred_optimize 2
	//cl_smooth 0 //switch this to 1 if you're making a frag video, 0 if you're playing the game
	//cl_smoothtime 0.01 //mess with this if you're making a frag video for smoothing effects
 
//Pick one of these 2 to use, doesn't really matter which, just stick with it from now on.
	//cl_interp 0.0303 // Default Interp setting; Forgiving buffer between you and server, useful for hitscan like amby/sniper rifle
	//cl_interp 0.0152 // As close as possible to server, good for knife/projectiles. Take care when using this, it does come with issues: https://docs.mastercomfig.com/9.5.2/tf2/misconceptions/#bad-cvars
	
//----------------
// Execute configs
//----------------

	//exec prec		    	//Uncomment if you use P-Rec(TF2 now has a bit worse but functional automatic demo recording built in)
	//exec scoreboard		//Uncomment to use advanced scoreboard script that pops up the full net graph. This only works initially, you have to enable the same setting in each class config as needed.
	//exec crouchjump		//Uncomment to enable spacebar automatically performing a crouch jump without having to press your crouch key. This only works initially, you have to enable the same setting in each class config as needed.
							//Note that this is not recommended for high level rocket/sticky jumping as it DOES NOT CTAP PROPERLY
							//For those who don't main Soldier or Demo, it is very useful for explosion surfing as a means of escape.
//---------------
// Mouse settings
//---------------

	//sensitivity 2.00 	    //Change this to your normal sensitivity, personally I find lower is better for sniper/amby
				  			//Just never ever change your sensitivity, especially between weapons
				  			//It really screws with muscle memory if you do that

// Misc stuff

	fov_desired 90 									//Everyone should use 90 FOV, no excuses "Mr. Some-counter-strike-1.6-pros-use-it"

	cl_hud_playerclass_use_playermodel 0			//Disables 3D playermodel. MasterComfig has this option, but I left this here as a backup for HUD editing.
	
//Disable voice + chat
	//If you have my "talk" and "notalk" configs you can type:
	//"exec talk" in console to enable again
	//"exec notalk" in console to disable again
	//Some custom HUDs have these built into their menus.

//Access inventory / drop items from console by typing these commands in

//Preload the game to get some mods working, get it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/swgl0x110jatxi2/preload_room.bsp?dl=1
//Comment this out if you do not have the map
//I use it alongside the map_background launch option because sometimes my game wouldn't preload work with only one of them
// Feel free to experement with only using the launch option / autoexec one though.
