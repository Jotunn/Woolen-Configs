//Everything in here is executed on TF2's initial launch
//Feel free to add/remove/modify stuff as you please

//Jöt's note: I have altered and added to this to work better with MasterComfig,
//as well as making it easier to use for editing a custom HUD. Aside from that,
//grammar mistakes in the notes were cleaned up, and indentation has been evened;
//the math for heapsize has been done for the most common range of RAM capacities.
//More information has been added to explain functions of code where relevant/useful.
//I also cleaned up the class configs and their various inconsistencies.

// Don't mess with them unless you know what you're doing, MasterComfig has most of these covered for most users, uncomment and alter what you need only for your playstyle and specific needs.

	//cl_updaterate 67 //just keep these as the same number

//Pick one of these 2 to use, doesn't really matter which, just stick with it from now on.
	//cl_interp 0.035 // Forgiving buffer between you and server, useful for hitscan like amby/sniper rifle
	//cl_interp 0.0152 // As close as possible to server, good for knife/projectiles
	
//----------------
// Execute configs
//----------------

	//exec prec		    	//Uncomment if you use P-Rec(TF2 now has a bit worse but functional automatic demo recording built in)
	//exec scoreboard		//Uncomment to use advanced scoreboard script that pops up the full net graph. This only works initially, you have to enable the same setting in each class config as needed.
	//exec crouchjump		//Uncomment to enable spacebar automatically performing a crouch jump without having to press your crouch key. This only works initially, you have to enable the same setting in each class config as needed.
							//Note that this is not recommended for high level rocket/sticky jumping as it DOES NOT CTAP PROPERLY
							//For those who don't main Soldier or Demo, it is very useful for explosion surfing as a means of escape.
